					 <p>Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is no longer a terminal diagnosis for cats. Thousands of people
						 have been sucessfully treating their cats using the antiviral GS-441524 (GS for short).
						 This antiviral treatment can be obtained by getting in touch with admins from
						 various facebook groups dedicated to treating FIP.  The main group for helping
						 individuals gain access to GS is
						 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/804374446995270"> FIP Warriors</a>.
						 Ask to be added, and get in touch with an admin ASAP who will be able to
						 help you purchase GS.

						 <p>There are numerous brands of GS available. Admins in the group
							 keep track of brands and treatment outcomes.  This allows
							 admins to help you treat your cat using brands likely to result in
							 successful outcomes.

				 <div class="col-md-4">
					 <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
					 <p> Although FIP is now curable, the treatment is not inexpensive.
						 Costs will depend on your cat's weight and other symptoms. Typically,
					  	costs vary from around $2,500 to $8,000 for the duration of treatment.
							You can estimate the costs of treatment based on data that individuals
							like you have logged on this website.

				 <div class="col-md-4">
					 <h2>Scientific Basis?</h2>
					 <p>Researchers at the University of California-Davis have spent decades researching FIP.
						 Up until their <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30755068/">groundbreaking study</a> that
						 came out in 2019, FIP was largely regarded as a terminal disease in cats, with most
						 vets recommending euthanasia.  Since mid-2019, tens-of-thousands of cat
						 owners everywhere have been able to cure their cats of FIP.

							 <p>GS-441524 is not the end goal for treating cats with FIP. Everyone that has
								 been through this process can attest that there needs to be something better.
								 Injecting an uncooperative cat for 84 days is far from ideal.
								 There is an organization, <a href="https://www.zenbycat.org/">ZenByCat</a>,
								 which is setup to raise money for research to support finding a better treatment for FIP.
								 If you have made it this far, please consider becoming a monthly donor
